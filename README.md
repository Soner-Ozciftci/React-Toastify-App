To use React Toastify, you need to install it using npm with the command
"npm install react-toastify"
or with Yarn using "yarn add react-toastify".

After that, you should import the React Toastify components in your project at the appropriate location:
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

The main component of React Toastify is called ToastContainer, which represents the area where the notifications will be displayed. The library provides the toast object for communication, allowing you to control the notifications.

Note :

I used Background for https://heropatterns.com
I used Button color for https://colorhunt.com
